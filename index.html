<h2>About Us</h2>

<p>We are a charity based in Torfaen that aims to help local young people become healthier and more active through a variety of activities. We are a non-profit organisation that could not operate without our generous donators and tireless volunteers. If you are interested in contributing to our work please check out the donate or volunteer pages.
  
We work with young people ages 6-16 and provide a wide variety of age appropriate activities, from soft play trips for younger ages, to paintballing for older participants. Participation in standard activities, such as football, netball and other sports, cost Â£1 per participant while extra activities, such as paintball, may cost more based on admission costs and other factors.
